# pb-cpg-tools-docker

[pb-cpg-tools](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/pb-cpg-tools) provides the tool `aligned_bam_to_cpg_scores`, which can generate site methylation probabilities from mapped HiFi reads, including probabilities for each haplotype when reads are haplotagged. pb-cpg-tools-docker provides Docker files and GitHub Action workflows for building and publishing a Docker image so that pb-cpg-tools can be used in the [sync-seq](https://github.com/adeslatt/sync-seq) workflow.

sync-seq provides a Nextflow workflow encapsulating the computational components to take output from the 15:1 molar libraries of gDNA:cDNA sequenced on the PacBio Revio following the protocols published by Vollger, Mitchell R., Jonas Korlach, Kiara C. Eldred, Elliott Swanson, Jason G. Underwood, Yong-Han H. Cheng, Jane Ranchalis, et al. 2023. “Synchronized Long-Read Genome, Methylome, Epigenome, and Transcriptome for Resolving a Mendelian Condition.” Preprint. Genetics. https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.09.26.559521.
